# Turnover Estimation Framework — Project Context

This file gives Claude Code persistent context on this project. Read it before making changes.

## Objective

Estimate missing annual turnover for UK space-sector companies using supervised
machine learning, to complete a baseline dataset used later for a separate 2030
forecasting framework. This is **current-turnover estimation**, not future forecasting.

Formally: learn `y_hat_i = f(x_i)` from companies with observed turnover, then apply
`f` to companies with missing turnover.

## Target and data shape (see DATA_SCHEMA.md for full detail)

- Target = **Total Turnover** (not Space Turnover — that field is unused).
- Data is used in **long/panel format**: one row per (company, year), not one
  row per company. This multiplies effective sample size.
- Because multiple rows belong to the same company, **all cross-validation
  must group by company ID** (`GroupKFold`/`GroupShuffleSplit`), never plain
  random k-fold — otherwise the same company leaks across train/validation.
- Mission assignment: space companies are segmented via
  `data/mission_mapping.csv` (Value Stream -> Mission). Adjacent companies
  arrive pre-segmented (already exported as 3 separate mission-specific
  Beauhurst collections) — no run-time mapping needed for them.
- Adjacent-company data will likely follow Source 1's raw Beauhurst schema
  (repeated Financial Statement blocks), not Source 2's curated master-sheet
  schema — design shared feature engineering around Source 1's structure.

## Key structural rules (do not violate these)

- **Three independent mission models**: Autonomous and Connected Earth (ACE),
  Beyond Earth, Resilient Earth. Each mission gets its own dataset, its own
  regression bake-off, and its own selected model. Do not pool missions into one model.
- **Cross-cutting companies** are excluded from modelling entirely (retained for
  reference only) — they can't be assigned to a single mission without extra assumptions.
  (Planned extension, not yet built — see "Planned: cross-cutting predictions" below.)
- **Adjacent-company datasets** (one per mission) exist only to enlarge the labelled
  training set. They are never part of the inference/prediction population.
  Model *selection* must be validated on held-out **space companies only**, not
  pooled space+adjacent performance.
- **No leakage, ever**: all preprocessing (imputation, encoding, scaling, target
  transforms), feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning must be fit inside the
  training fold only (sklearn `Pipeline` + cross-validation), never on the full
  dataset before splitting.
- **Observed turnover values are never overwritten by predictions.** Predictions
  are only generated for companies with missing turnover.
- Every predicted value carries a `turnover_source` (observed/predicted) and a
  reliability/confidence indicator.

## Pipeline stages (implement as separate modules — see `src/`)

1. `data_prep.py` — schema validation, duplicate resolution, variable
   standardisation, missingness assessment, eligibility filtering.
   **Duplicate resolution rule**: two rows are the same company only if they
   share a CH number *and* a normalised name. A shared CH number with
   genuinely different names is a data-quality anomaly, not a duplicate
   identity — log it, but never merge those rows' financials or mission
   assignments. Company name is the deciding factor, not CH number alone
   (some CH numbers are legitimately reused across distinct legal entities,
   e.g. a parent charity's number appearing on multiple affiliated orgs).
   Expect more of these once the ~23k adjacent dataset is added.
2. `mission_segmentation.py` — split space-company dataset into ACE / Beyond Earth /
   Resilient Earth / cross-cutting (excluded); merge each with its adjacent dataset.
3. `sample_construction.py` — within each mission dataset, split into labelled
   (observed turnover) vs inference (missing turnover) populations.
4. `feature_engineering.py` — company characteristics, financial indicators,
   commercial activity, categorical features, composite indicators. Must only use
   information available at prediction time (no target leakage).
5. `model_bakeoff.py` — candidate models: Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net,
   Random Forest, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, SVR, k-NN. Cross-validated
   hyperparameter search per model, per mission. Metrics: MAE, RMSE, R².
6. `model_selection.py` — pick best model per mission (accuracy + stability +
   prefer simpler model on ties); refit on full labelled data for that mission.
7. `predict.py` — apply selected mission models to each mission's inference
   population; attach reliability/out-of-distribution indicators.
8. `assemble.py` — recombine observed + predicted turnover across all three
   missions (+ cross-cutting passthrough) into the final completed dataset.

## Tech stack

- Python, pandas, scikit-learn (Pipeline, ColumnTransformer, cross_val_score / GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV)
- Fixed random seeds everywhere for reproducibility
- pytest for tests in `tests/`

## Data locations

- Raw input datasets: `data/raw/` (main space dataset + 3 adjacent datasets — not yet added)
- Processed/intermediate outputs: `data/processed/`
- Final completed dataset: `data/output/`

## Data sources

See `DATA_SCHEMA.md` for the structure of the two source Excel files
(Beauhurst raw export + mission-tagged master sheet) and open questions that
need resolving before feature engineering can be finalised.

## Current status / build order (adjusted)

No adjacent-company data available yet (~23k planned, not ready). Build order
is deliberately re-sequenced to prove out the ML core first, using only the
~400 space companies with known turnover:

1. `data_prep.py` + `feature_engineering.py` — scoped to the space-company
   dataset only (skip adjacent-company harmonisation for now)
2. `model_bakeoff.py` — cross-validated comparison on the ~400 labelled
   companies. **Build `sample_weight` support into the model-fitting code
   from the start** (default weight = 1.0 for every row), even though it's
   unused until adjacent data arrives — this avoids re-architecting later.
   With only ~400 rows, use careful CV (e.g. repeated k-fold) and watch fold
   variance.
3. Once adjacent-company data (~23k rows) is available: extend
   `mission_segmentation.py` to merge it in, assign adjacent companies to
   missions via an external SIC/industry mapping (they won't have
   `Value Stream`), and set adjacent rows to a lower `sample_weight` than
   space companies so the model trusts them less.

Validate each stage against a small toy sample before moving to the next.

## Planned: cross-cutting company predictions (not yet built)

The written methodology only says cross-cutting companies (Consultancy / Other,
Explore New Markets Value Streams) are "retained for reference." We eventually
want turnover predictions for them too, which goes beyond that — this is an
explicitly deferred extra step, to be built only after the core 3-mission
pipeline works end-to-end:

- At **prediction time only** (never for training), assign each cross-cutting
  company a best-guess mission via buzzword/keyword similarity to the three
  mission categories — reusing the same buzzword-based logic planned for
  adjacent-company mission assignment (adjacent companies won't have `Value
  Stream` either, so this logic is shared).
- Score the company with whichever mission model that best-guess assignment
  points to.
- Mark these predictions clearly as **"approximate"** in the reliability/
  confidence indicator (distinct from normal predicted-vs-observed status),
  since the mission assignment itself is inferred, not given.
- Cross-cutting companies still never enter training data for any mission
  model, no exceptions — this only affects what happens at inference time.

## Data quality exclusions from training (see DATA_SCHEMA.md for detail)

- The `Value Stream == "Sky UK"` row is a data-entry error (own company name
  pasted into the field) — excluded from mission mapping entirely, not folded
  into Cross-cutting.
- 6 Companies House numbers in Source 2 were originally shared by multiple
  company rows (11 rows). 2 were confirmed data-entry errors and corrected
  in `data_prep.py` (GeoData Institute's bogus CH number nulled; ISVR
  Consulting's corrected to `14701170`). The remaining 4 groups (9 rows) are
  genuinely different companies that happen to share a reused CH number
  (e.g. a parent charity's number) — logged as `shared_ch_number_anomaly`
  but **not** excluded from training, since company name (not CH number
  alone) decides identity. Only a true duplicate (same CH number *and* same
  normalised name) is excluded pending manual review; there are currently
  none. See DATA_SCHEMA.md for the full list.
